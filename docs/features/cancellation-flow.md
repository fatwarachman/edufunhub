# Self-Service Cancellation Flow

## Overview

The Self-Service Cancellation Flow provides users with a streamlined, empathetic process for cancelling their subscription while offering targeted retention offers based on their cancellation reason.

## Features

### Multi-Step Cancellation Process

#### Step 1: Reason Collection
Users select their primary cancellation reason:
- **Too expensive** → Offer: 20% discount for 3 months
- **Missing features** → Offer: Roadmap discussion + feature request
- **Not using enough** → Offer: Downgrade to Free plan suggestion
- **Switched to competitor** → Offer: Feedback collection
- **Temporary break** → Offer: Pause subscription option
- **Other** → No offer, proceed to confirmation

Optional feedback textarea for additional context.

#### Step 2: Retention Offer (Conditional)
Based on the selected reason, users see a contextual retention offer:
- Discount codes for price-sensitive users
- Feature roadmap for users needing specific functionality
- Downgrade options for low-usage users
- Pause option for temporary breaks

Users can accept the offer or continue with cancellation.

#### Step 3: Final Confirmation
Clear display of:
- Subscription end date
- Continued access until end date
- No further charges
- Data preservation period (30 days)
- Resume option availability

#### Step 4: Success Confirmation
- Confirmation message
- Access end date reminder
- Automatic page reload after 2 seconds
